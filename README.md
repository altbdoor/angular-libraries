# Issues

It's not an easy task to build this lib, so there are some pending issues we're well aware of. Here's a list.

## Major Issues
- Ranges... => disabled :(
- handle multi-key commands
- newline / enter behaves weirdly

## Minor Issues
- On the word "Yo" in some fonts, the o is below the Y. The border right/left of the cursor then changes this by drawing a hard line between the two, causing a slight jumping behaviour of the text...
- improve left / right arrow keys
