# TODOS

# risky
- ranges...
- newline / enter behaves weirdly

## low risk
- handle up / down arrow keys
- improve left / right arrow keys (not so important, barely noticable bug with current solution)

# PROBLEMS
- dead spots where you cannot click
- Ranges... => disabled :(
- handle clicking outside, dealing with focus
- handle multi-key commands
- double clicking on word doesn't always highlight word
