# TODOS

# risky
- handling blurring
- only show keyboard if there is no physical device connected => detect if cursor is set with mouse: if yes, then don't show the keyboard, if no, then show keyboard... or... just always show the keyboard...?
- handle arrow keys...
- if abcde breaks to newline after c and you hit arrow left on de, you should first jump to left of d and then to right of e...
- handle clicks that aren't exactly on elements
- let final solution user test

## low risk
- 123 TAB
- special chars TAB

# PROBLEMS
- dead spots where you cannot click
- Handle ranges
- handle clicking outside, dealing with focus
- handle multi-key commands
- double clicking on word doesn't always highlight word
